# flutter_template_app

A Flutter application template to use when creating new projects.

## Getting Started

This project contains the following features:
 - a ready to use network state management
 - a base service class
 - a base repository class

My goal on this project is to have a template that:
 - uses the repository design pattern to load data from local database or from a remote web service
 - manages generic actions of the app using the command design pattern
 - in genral, a clean architecture of the whole project

Other features will be added in the future.

I'll try to do my best to create a useful starting point to create great Flutter apps!
Please, anyone who wants to help me is welcome and any contribute, on the code side or simply on the structure of the template, is well appreciated.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
